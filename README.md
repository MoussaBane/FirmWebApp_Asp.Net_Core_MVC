# FirmWebApp_Asp.Net_Core_MVC

This project involves creating a web application based on .NET Core MVC and designing a monitoring screen using the DevExtreme library. The monitoring screen helps visually manage test areas in a factory and the test machines within them.

Machines are placed in layouts and color-coded based on their operational status.

## Project Highlights

The project includes the following steps:

1. **CRUD Operations and Popup Windows:**
   - Created popup windows for easy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Layout and Machine objects. For example, set up 2 layouts and added 3 machine records to each layout.

2. **Adding the DevExtreme Library:**
   - Built a web application using .NET Core.
   - Incorporated the DevExtreme library to provide powerful user interface components.

3. **Creating Layout and Show Button:**
   - Designed layouts for the monitoring screen. Used the "Show" button to access the monitoring screen.

4. **Using the DevExtreme Diagram Component:**
   - Utilized the DevExtreme Diagram component on the monitoring screen. This component enables visual organization and display of objects.

5. **Diagram Resizing:**
   - Adjusted the diagram screen's size based on the width and height specified in the layout.

6. **Adding Machine Objects:**
   - Placed rectangular objects on relevant layouts to represent machine records accurately, including their positions and sizes.

7. **Mouse Hover Functionality:**
   - Enabled info1 and info2 fields to appear when hovering over rectangular objects.

8. **Exploring DevExtreme Demo Applications:**
   - Studied DevExtreme's demo applications to learn about using components and to find example codes.
