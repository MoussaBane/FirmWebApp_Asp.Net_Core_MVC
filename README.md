# FirmWebApp_Asp.Net_Core_MVC

This project involves creating a .NET Core MVC-based web application and designing a monitoring screen using the DevExtreme library. The monitoring screen allows visual management of test areas in a factory and the test machines located within them.

Machines are positioned within specific layouts and colored based on their operational status.

## Project Contents

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **CRUD Operations and Popup Windows:**
   - Popup windows have been created to facilitate CRUD operations for Layout and Machine objects. For instance, 2 layouts and 3 machine records in each layout have been generated.

2. **Adding the DevExtreme Library:**
   - A .NET Core-based web application has been set up.
   - The DevExtreme library has been integrated into the project, offering a rich array of user interface components.

3. **Creating Layout and Show Button:**
   - Layout design has been tailored for the monitoring screen. The "Show" button is employed to unveil the monitoring screen.

4. **Using the DevExtreme Diagram Component:**
   - The DevExtreme Diagram component takes center stage in the monitoring screen. This component empowers visual arrangement and display of objects.

5. **Diagram Resizing:**
   - The diagram screen dynamically adjusts its dimensions according to the width and height stipulated in the layout object.

6. **Adding Machine Objects:**
   - Rectangular objects corresponding to each machine record are seamlessly integrated into the relevant layout, respecting specified coordinates and dimensions.

7. **Mouse Hover Functionality:**
   - Hovering over rectangular objects triggers the display of info1 and info2 fields via the mouse hover feature.

8. **Examining DevExtreme Demo Applications:**
   - By delving into DevExtreme's demo applications, one can glean insights into component utilization and explore example codes.
